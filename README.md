Personal website for Jamie Amparan

## Milestone 1 Feedback

Good work here - your Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona are concise and to the point. The audience section of your site could be more detailed. Definitely think in depth about your audience. It says professional audience but who does that refer to? Are you thinking of recruiters? non-profit orgs? venture capitalists? etc.. Be sure to think of these as you move further into your project. I'm looking forward to seeing your content strategy and UI design concepts to come in Milestone 2a.

Your project and files are all set up to spec and your code looks great.

Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier III. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2Î±.


## Milestone 2a Feedback

Good work on these wireframes. The layouts on desktop and mobile you provided will work for this project. The accompanying content strategy ideas could use a little more detail. Don't forget to think about the tone you want to set with your use of words. This is just something to note for your written content throughout your site. Nonetheless, everything you have here in your content strategy will help you in the development phase ahead.

For the portfolio section of your site here is my first recommendation to find the type of image carousel you're looking for:
https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/

I would also suggest looking into using an interactive gallery such as [FancyBox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/)
You might also want to take a look at this here if you're also looking at making your photos have some animated: https://tympanus.net/Development/HoverEffectIdeas/index.html


Additional recommendations:

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)for custom typography - it has ~1000 fonts and is easy to integrate. will have all the documentation
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)you need for generating a quick layout for your site.
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)is a good quality free library for including iconography.
* [Animate CSS](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) animation library for CSS
* [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com/) another JavaScript library for working with image galleries

Your Milestone 2a passes at Tier III. You are now clear to begin development on your PWP.

We'll be building PWP in a file named index.php inside of /public_html. Please note that no frontend-facing site files should live outside of the /public_html directory. Remember use an organized and standards-compliant directory structure to house all images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. We are done with the /documentation directory for now!
