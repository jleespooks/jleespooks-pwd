Personal website for Jamie Amparan

## Milestone 1 Feedback

Good work here - your Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona are concise and to the point. The audience section of your site could be more detailed. Definitely think in depth about your audience. It says professional audience but who does that refer to? Are you thinking of recruiters? non-profit orgs? venture capitalists? etc.. Be sure to think of these as you move further into your project. I'm looking forward to seeing your content strategy and UI design concepts to come in Milestone 2a.

Your project and files are all set up to spec and your code looks great.

Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier III. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2Î±.
